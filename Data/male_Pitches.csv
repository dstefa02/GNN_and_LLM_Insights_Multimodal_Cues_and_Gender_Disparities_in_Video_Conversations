So, while I was getting my master's degree at NYU University, I took an introductory Electronics course where we had to make a device for the home, and I wanted to remake an alarm clock. And so I can rest my fellow students asking them what their ideal way to wake up was now, I can't say what the number one answer was on television, but the close second was the smell and taste of bacon. And so inspired. I went home and I built the world's first alarm. that actually wakes you up with bacon, here's how it works. So the night before you open up the chamber and you put in a couple of slices of pre-cooked bacon and then you set the alarm for say 7:00 a.m. the next morning at 650. The clock silently turns on and it heats up the bacon to a crisp. So that the smell is really strong and can wake up any bacon lover. You can then actually just roll over in bed, open it up and eat the bacon yourself, you can cook the bacon and then eat it. That's right. Shut up, I'm serious. I built this and I thought it was a lark, so I posted on my website and wakin bacon went viral. I've been inundated with hundreds and hundreds of emails of people who are begging me to sell them one. And so with the money I'm asking for, I want to redesign this for mass production and get a functional prototype, so that I can go pitch this to Retail Partners in manufacturing partners and investors.

And my company is windcatcher technology but I'm here today seeking two hundred thousand dollars in exchange for a percent of my company. Now anyone who's tried inflating an object like this knows what a huge pain, it can be. They take forever to inflates. And you have to put your mouth on a valve and if it's see here that I thought blown into this conventional valve twice, this bag is hardly inflated. Windcatcher changes all that because a single breath of air, it was able to inflate this entire shark and this is because when catcher is a radically different information technology that allows you to inflate an object this size in seconds without using any power or humping. Wow. Already integrate this technology into our Flagship product are pad to was like all of our products and flights and packs up in seconds. Amazing. Yeah, but because it's so easy to inflate. I also designed it the pulled up and double as a seat. So as you can see, you can attach these straps and use it as both a seat or a pad. And sharks, this is just the beginning. The applications for windcatcher technology are endless. So let me ask you, which one of you is ready to help me, blow away the competition? really impressive. Thanks, you're gonna tell us how it works, right? So what's happening is? And the reason is different than an ordinary valve is because we take advantage of this phenomenon called entrainment, so it's in training or sucking in the surrounding air. So each time I blow into this valve, As actually sucking in the surrounding air, it's a stream of fast, moving low, pressure air, so it inflates 10 times faster than a conventional valve. What premium do I pay for this technology versus at any other air mattress?"

That's not going to work for me for those Reasons. I'm out. So, I'm trying to figure out, how, how are you getting to that valuation? Ian I'm choking on the valuation. Is it the need for that amount of capital? Is a you just think you're going to be that good. Because usually business figures itself out in 7 years, the valuation largely came from the fact that we were able to raise that valuation before.

Are the two main reasons you've been in business for eight years and you have five point two million dollars. I have another sock business Grace and lace and they were in business for five years and I have 15 million dollars. That's a sizeable difference. I believe that the problem you have that they don't have is they have 70% returning customers, you're in the new baby business. So it's very, very expensive for you to constantly start and find new customers. And I believe that's why you're only doing 50 percent online.
